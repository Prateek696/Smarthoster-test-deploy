      "description": "At SmartHoster, we've already automated 90% of what matters: Our invoicing software handles all commission and payout logic, SEF and eFatura reporting is handled internally or semi-automated, Smart pricing, calendar syncing, and guest communication are built-in. But we're not a walled garden. If you want to connect to external tools — for cleaning, smart locks, pricing, or analytics — we're integrated and ready to go. This is about optional power. And it's all plug-and-play."
