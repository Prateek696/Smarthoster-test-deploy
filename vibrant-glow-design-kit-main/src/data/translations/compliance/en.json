As of October 29, 2023, the responsibilities previously held by SEF (Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras) have been transferred to AIMA (Agência para a Imigração e Mobilidade), the new agency overseeing immigration and mobility matters. This reporting is conducted through the SIBA (Sistema de Informação de Boletins de Alojamento) platform."
