Guests complained about difficult check-ins, communication was slow, and the place just needed a refresh.\n\nWe repainted, made a few interior upgrades, and got new professional photos. But the biggest change? Installing a full self-check-in system — at the entrance gate and the front door. Suddenly, guests arrived smoothly, no waiting, no stress.\n\nWe also rebuilt my accounts from the ground up. My previous listings had a rough start, so we reset and relaunched on Airbnb, Booking.com, and VRBO. The first few weeks were quiet, but after the first 10 five-star reviews, bookings started pouring in.\n\nSmartHoster took care of the details I didn't know I was missing. Now I have consistent occupancy, happier guests, and far less to worry about."

Our accountant loves it. The dashboards are clear, the numbers are accurate, and we don't waste time chasing paperwork.\n\nWhat used to take up hours of admin time is now fully automated. We've taken a step back operationally and focused on expanding our portfolio here in Porto. Everything runs under one system. It's structured, clean, and scalable. Honestly, it just makes sense."

They helped me redo the property photos, improve the bedding quality, and rethink how I presented the space.\n\nThe biggest surprise? A €400 inflatable jacuzzi and a €250 custom wood deck around it. That's it — and it completely changed the game. Suddenly, I was getting winter bookings, guests loved the cozy outdoor vibe, and my reviews went up.\n\nSmartHoster doesn't just manage things — they add value in ways I never expected. I'm now earning more, with less stress, and the house is booked year-round."

        "answer": "The complete onboarding process typically takes 7-14 days from initial consultation to going live. This includes property assessment, professional photography, platform setup, and compliance documentation. We pride ourselves on having one of the fastest setup times in the industry while maintaining the highest quality standards."
      },
      "fees": {
        "question": "Are there any hidden fees beyond the management percentage?",
        "answer": "There are no hidden fees. Our transparent pricing model means you only pay the agreed management percentage on successful bookings. This covers all our services including marketing, guest support, cleaning coordination, and compliance management. You'll never receive surprise charges or additional service fees."
      },
      "compliance": {
        "question": "How do you ensure legal compliance with Portuguese regulations?",
        "answer": "We maintain partnerships with legal experts and stay current with all Portuguese short-term rental regulations. Our system automatically handles SEF reporting, tax obligations, and licensing requirements. We provide complete documentation support and ensure 100% compliance with local laws and registration requirements."

      "emergency": {
        "question": "What happens during emergencies or urgent situations?",
        "answer": "Our 24/7 emergency response team is always available for urgent situations. We have established relationships with local contractors, maintenance professionals, and security services. Guests receive immediate assistance, and property owners are notified of any incidents with complete documentation and resolution updates."
      },
      "personal": {
        "question": "Can I still use my property for personal stays?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We work around your personal schedule and block out dates when you want to use your property. Our calendar management system makes it easy to reserve time for yourself, family visits, or personal vacations. You maintain complete control over your property's availability."
      },
      "cleaningFees": {
        "question": "How do cleaning fees work?",
        "answer": "Cleaning fees are paid by the guest, not the property owner.\nThey're added to each booking and passed directly to the cleaning team.\n\nWe handle the rest — scheduling, communication, and quality control.\nYou don't pay out of pocket, and it's not part of our management percentage."
      },
      "cancellation": {
        "question": "What's the cancellation policy?",
        "answer": "We offer a 15-day cancellation policy on management agreements.\nYou're not locked into long contracts — this gives you flexibility to change or pause services as needed."
      },
      "payment": {
        "question": "How does payment work?",
        "answer": "We're flexible.\n\nYou can receive guest payments directly and we bill you our percentage —\nor, we can collect everything and transfer your earnings minus our fee.\n\nWhatever works best for you."
      },
      "contract": {
        "question": "Is the contract month-to-month?",
        "answer": "Yes. All management agreements are month-to-month with 15-day notice.\nNo long-term commitments, no headaches."
      },
      "cleaningTeam": {
        "question": "Do I have to use your cleaning team?",
        "answer": "No — we offer in-house cleaning coordination, but it's optional.\n\nIf you have your own cleaning staff, we can integrate them into the schedule.\nOtherwise, we handle everything for you with verified professional teams."
